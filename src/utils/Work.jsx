  description: `As a marketing intern, I was in-charge of creating daily content for the companyâ€™s instagram, and sending out monthly EDMs. The company uses Adobe Photoshop for their digital designs, and over the course of 4 months, I went from knowing close to zero about Adobe Photoshop to independently generating multiple digital assets daily.\nI was also given the opportunity to plan the content calendar for the company and work with external consultants on how to better optimize the company's marketing strategy. Through the process of trial and error over the last month of my internship, I was able to help the company create a better workflow for their marketing and was put in-charge of training the new marketing interns and hires before leaving the company.`,

Through this, I was able to learn how to engage with founders and gained a deep understanding about the global start-up ecosystem. \nI was later entrusted with the responsibility of doing the initial screening (in the form of 1-on-1 interviews) for founders who were interested in collaborating with REAPRA. I was conducting a minimum of 5 interviews every week with founders mostly based in the SEA region. \nAlthough my internship was supposed to be from February to May, the company extended an offer for me to continue working part-time with them in the same role until my school semester started in August.`,
